# MSN-Explorer-Enabler

This uses [redbean](https://redbean.dev) to serve the necessary files for MSN Explorer 6 and 7 to believe it has logged in to MSN.

## Usage
1. [Download](https://github.com/Sgeo/MSN-Explorer-Enabler/releases/latest) the pre-prepared redbean and MSN6.INI.
1. Run `redbean-2.2-msn.com`. Note that this is a 64-bit program, so will not run directly on most Windows XP systems.
1. Place MSN6.INI into MSNCoreFiles. Change the PassportClientXML as needed to point to Redbean (e.g. if it's on a different machine)
1. Login to MSN Explorer as a guest, with any username and any password.
